Description:
The purpose of the website is to demonstrate my experience to a professional.
I convey my personal experience and expertise through this website.
It is interesting and engaging because of its interactive components, 
and the overall design.
Target audience is professionals, but also everyone who whats to know me.

Using my website:
- Click on nav-bar for sections
- Download my resume button
- Sliding the carousel
- Sending me a message (the form works so feel free to send me actual message!)

External tools:
- Bootstrap 5 because it delivers clear formatting. I used it with sass for customized styling so that I can choose a different theme than default bootstrap 5 colors
- FormSumbit.co becuase it helps with activating forms in html

Iteration from HW7:
- I have changed the project layout and added courses section from hw7.
- Added interactive elements with web framework.

Major challenges:
- Overall bootstrap application and debugging.
- Carousel is hard to implement with responsive design in mind.
